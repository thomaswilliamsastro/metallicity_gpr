# The Two-Dimensional Metallicity Distribution of Nearby Galaxies

This repository contains the code used in Williams et al. (2021 in prep.). The flow is as follows:

* `pix_by_pix_metallicity_maps` will create metallicity maps from the convolved MUSE cubes in a pixel-by-pixel 
  manner
* `create_initial_metallicity_maps` will TODO
